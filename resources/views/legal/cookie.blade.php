        This Cookie Statement explains how https://YourUnity.org and its affiliated companies (collectively “YourUnity”, "we", "us", and "ours") use cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you visit our websites and mobile applications (together “Cookies”), including https://YourUnity.org, and any other webpages, subdomains, country level domain variants that link or refer to this Cookie Policy, all of the services available on or through the Site or otherwise provided by us, and all of our free mobile applications, including without limitation, the YourUnity app ("Site(s)"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control our use of them.
      </p>

      <h1>What are cookies?</h1>
          <p>
            Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.
            Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, YourUnity) are called "first party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third party cookies". Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. advertising, interactive content and analytics). The parties that set these third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other websites.
          </p>

      <h1>Why do we use cookies?</h1>
          <p>
              YourUnity uses first and third party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons in order for our Sites to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our Sites. Third parties serve cookies through our Sites for advertising, analytics and other purposes. This is described in more detail below.
              The specific types of first and third party cookies served through our Sites and the purposes they perform are described under "Essential 1st party cookies" and "Analytics and customization cookies" below (please note that the specific cookies served may vary depending on the specific Site you visit).
          </p>

      <h1>Essential 1st party cookies</h1>
          <p>
              These cookies are strictly necessary to provide you with services available through our Sites and to use some of its features, such as access to secure areas.
              Who serves these cookies:
              • YourUnity.org and related top level domains.
              How to refuse:
              Because these cookies are strictly necessary to deliver the Sites to you, you cannot refuse them.
              You may block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described below under the heading "How can I control cookies?", but you may not be able to use any Site features.
          </p>

      <h1>Analytics and customization cookies</h1>
          <p>
              These cookies collect information that is used either in aggregate form to help us understand how our Sites are being used or how effective are marketing campaigns are, or to help us customize our Sites for you.
              Who services these cookies:
              <br/>• Yahoo
              <br/>• Bing
              <br/>• AdWords
              <br/>• Twitter
              <br/>• Facebook
              <br/>• Google Tag Manager

              <br/><br/>How to refuse:
              <br/>To refuse these cookies, please follow the instructions below under the heading "How can I control cookies?"
          </p>

      <h1>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</h1>
          <p>
              Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. Web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs") are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when someone has visited our Sites or taking an action in relation to our Sites. We also facilitate our organizers ability to learn more about your interest in their event at their request through the use of these tracking pixels. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly. As a result, declining cookies will impair their functioning.
          </p>

      <h1>Does YourUnity allow for Social Networking Cookies?</h1>
          <p>
              Yes, these cookies are used to enable you to share pages and content that you find interesting, or events you might attend, on our Sites through third party social networking and other websites. These cookies may be used for advertising purposes too by those social networks.
          </p>

      <h1>What about Flash Cookies or Local Shared Objects?</h1>
          <p>
              Our Sites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local Shared Objects or "LSOs") to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention and for other site operations. If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the Website Storage Settings Panel. You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the Global Storage Settings Panel and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete existing Flash Cookies (referred to "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).
              Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in connection with our Sites.
          </p>

      <h1>What about targeted advertising?</h1>
          <p>
              We do not offer you 3rd party advertising on our Sites. Organizers may also employ technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. This can be accomplished by them using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to our Sites and other sites in order to provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. The information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other personally identifying details unless you choose to provide these.
          </p>

      <h1>How can I control cookies?</h1>
          <p>
              You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie preferences through your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies. If you choose to reject cookies via your browser, you may still use our Sites through your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from browser-to-browser, you should visit your browser's help menu for more information.
          </p>

      <h1>How often will you update this Cookie Statement?</h1>
          <p>
              We may update this Cookie Statement from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Statement regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.
              The date at the top of this Cookie Statement indicates when it was last updated.
          </p>

      <h1>Where can I get further information?</h1>
          <p>
              If you have any questions about our use of cookies or other technologies, please email us at legal@YourUnity.com.
