    <h1>1. Who We Are.</h1>
        <h2>1.1 YourUnity.</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to YourUnity! We are a platform dedicated to building a stronger and more connected community by increasing awareness of and interaction with various community service events. Through our platform, mobile apps and services, we leverage the latest technology in order to reduce any barriers involved on both sides of the community service process. We are not a social media organization, as our aim is not to increase media consumption. Rather YourUnity aims to provide an avenue through which a User may more efficiently interact with the community around them.
            </p>

        <h2>1.2 The Services.</h2>
            <p>
                YourUnity’s websites and domains, including https://YourUnity.org, and all of the webpages, subdomains, country level domain variants and subparts of those websites (collectively, our “Site”), all of the services available on or through the Site or otherwise provided by us (including our application programming interfaces), and all of our free mobile applications (YourUnity app) are offered, maintained and provided by YourUnity. We refer to all of these as our “Services.”
            </p>

        <h2>1.3 Third Party Content.</h2>
            <p>
                All information, data, text, editorial content, design elements, look and feel, formatting, graphics, images, photographs, videos, music, sounds and other content (collectively, “Content”), relating to an event on the Services is posted by third party event organizers, attendees or other parties and not by YourUnity (collectively, “Third Party Content”). However, YourUnity takes intellectual property rights seriously. For that reason, we have created a simple process to deal with complaints of alleged infringement of third party trademark rights and copyrights by Third Party Content posted on the Services. This process covers copyrights (e.g., written text, photographs, sound recordings and video clips) and trademarks/servicemarks (e.g., logos, slogans and names identifying a good or service).
            </p>

        <h2>1.4 Application.</h2>
            <p>
                The following policy sets forth the process by which any third party who believes that their trademark and/or copyrights are being infringed by Third Party Content may have such Content removed from the Services.
            </p>

    <h1>2. Removing And Re-Posting Of Third Party Content.</h1>
        <h2>2.1 Getting Allegedly Infringing Content Removed.</h2>
            <p>
                If you believe in good faith that any Third Party Content made available in connection with the Services infringes your copyright or trademark rights, you (or your agent) may send us a takedown notice requesting that the Content be removed, or access to it be blocked. Such takedown notices need to contain the following information in order for YourUnity to be able to take action:
                a) Information reasonably sufficient to permit YourUnity to contact you (i.e., name and address, telephone number and/or email address);
                b) Sufficient information to identify the copyrighted works or trademarks that are allegedly being infringed, including registration number and registration office if applicable;
                c) Sufficient information to identify the allegedly infringing material that is to be removed and its Internet location (i.e., URL address);
                d) A statement that you have a good faith belief that the use of the material is not authorized by the owner, its agent or the law;
                e) A statement of the accuracy of the takedown notice, and under penalty of perjury, a statement that you are the owner of the allegedly infringed material or you are authorized to act on behalf of such owner; and
                f) A physical or electronic signature of the person submitting the takedown notice.
            </p>

        <h2>2.2 Liability.</h2>
            <p>
                Please note that by submitting a takedown notice, you agree that YourUnity may provide copies of such takedown notice to the alleged infringer and that the information in such takedown notice is subject to YourUnity’s Privacy Policy. In addition, you will be liable for any damages (including costs and attorneys’ fees) incurred by YourUnity or the alleged infringer in the event you knowingly and materially misrepresent that Third Party Content is infringing (taking into consideration copyright defenses (such as fair use) and exceptions). If you are unsure whether the material you are reporting is infringing, you should contact an attorney before filing a takedown notice. YourUnity cannot provide you with legal advice as to whether or not you are entitled to file a takedown notice.
            </p>

        <h2>2.3 Takedown.</h2>
            <p>
                Upon receiving a valid and fully completed takedown notice, YourUnity expeditiously removes or disables access to the allegedly infringing material and notifies the alleged infringing party.
            </p>

        <h2>2.4 Getting Content Reposted That Is Not Infringing.</h2>
            <p>
                Note that if your material has been removed by YourUnity from the Services, the fastest way to get your material re-posted is to remove the portions of your material that are allegedly infringing as specified in the takedown notice. However, if you cannot or will not remove the allegedly infringing material and you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or access was disabled by mistake or misidentification, you may email a counter notice to YourUnity. Such counter notices need to contain the following information in order for YourUnity to be able to take action:
                a) Information reasonably sufficient to permit YourUnity to contact you (i.e., name and address, telephone number and/or email address);
                b) Sufficient information to identify the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled and its location before removal (i.e., URL address);
                c) A statement under penalty of perjury that you have the good faith belief that the material was removed or access to the material was disabled by mistake or misidentification;
                d) A statement that you are the account holder of the account to which the takedown notice relates or an authorized representative of such account holder;
                e) A statement that you consent to jurisdiction of the federal district court in which your address is located, or if you reside outside the United States, for any judicial district in which YourUnity may be found, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of infringement or an agent of such person; and
                f) A physical or electronic signature of you or your authorized representative (i.e., an agent).
            </p>

        <h2>2.5 Notice Address.</h2>
