      <h1>1. Who We Are.</h1>
          <h2>1.1 YourUnity.</h2>
              <p>
                  Welcome to YourUnity! We are a platform dedicated to building a stronger and more connected community by increasing awareness of and interaction with various community service events. Through our platform, mobile apps and services, we leverage the latest technology in order to reduce any barriers involved on both sides of the community service process. We are not a social media organization, as our aim is not to increase media consumption. Rather YourUnity aims to provide an avenue through which a User may more efficiently interact with the community around them.
              </p>

          <h2>1.2 The Services.</h2>
              <p>

We refer to all of these as our “Services.”

          <h2>1.3 Users.</h2>
              <p>

              </p>

      <h1>5. Important Legal Terms Governing All Use Of The Services (AKA, The Legal “Stuff”).</h1>

              <p>

                  Except as set forth in Section 5.9 below, these Terms of Service and the provision of the Services to you are governed by the laws of the state of California, U.S.A., without reference to principles of conflict of laws.
              </p>

          <h2>5.9 BINDING ARBITRATION.</h2>
              <p>
                  ONLY FOR USERS LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES:
                  <br/>PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY AS IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. ANY DISPUTE OR CLAIM UNDER THESE TERMS OF SERVICE OR WITH RESPECT TO THE SERVICES WILL BE SETTLED BY BINDING ARBITRATION OR IN SMALL CLAIMS COURT (TO THE EXTENT THE CLAIM QUALIFIES) AND WILL TAKE PLACE ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS ONLY; CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE ARBITRATIONS AND CIVIL ACTIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED ONCE THIS SECTION IS EFFECTIVE.

                  <br/><br/>(a) Contact Us First.
                  <br/>If you have a question or concern about the Services, please contact us first. Our customer support team will try to answer your question or resolve your concern.

                  <br/><br/>(b) Agreement to Arbitrate.
                  <br/>In the unlikely event that our customer support team is unable to resolve your concerns, we each hereby agree to resolve any and all disputes or claims under these Terms of Service or with respect to the Services through binding arbitration or in small claims court (to the extent the claim qualifies) instead of in courts of general jurisdiction and only on an individual basis and not as part of any purported class, consolidated or representative proceeding. Arbitration, which is often cheaper, faster and less formal than a lawsuit in court, uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief as a court. Binding arbitration is subject to very limited review. Only the arbitrator appointed pursuant to this Section, and not any federal, state or local court or agency, shall have the authority to resolve any dispute or claim relating to this Section, including, without limitation, the scope, enforceability and arbitrability of these Terms of Service. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Service. These Terms of Service evidence a transaction in interstate commerce and the interpretation and enforcement of this Section 5.9 is governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, notwithstanding the choice of law set forth in Section 5.8 above.

                  <br/><br/>(c) Scope of Agreement.
                  <br/>This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to: (i) all claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory; (ii) all claims that arose before this or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising); and (iii) all claims that may arise after termination of these Terms of Service and/or your use of the Services.

                  <br/><br/>(d) Exceptions.
                  <br/>Notwithstanding this Agreement to arbitrate, either party may (i) bring an action on an individual basis in small claims court (to the extent the applicable claim qualifies), (ii) bring issues to the attention of federal, state or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Trade Commission and the California Division of Consumer Services, which agencies may be able to seek relief on a party’s behalf (the Complaint Assistance Unit of the Division of Consumer Services may be contacted in writing at 1625 North Market Blvd., Suite N 112, Sacramento, California 95834, or by telephone at (800) 952-5210), and (iii) bring suit in court to seek a preliminary injunction or other interim relief pending the outcome of arbitration. In addition, the portion of any dispute or complaint relating to our participation in the US-EU or US-Swiss Safe Harbor Frameworks is subject to the Dispute Resolution section of our Privacy Policy before being subject to this Section.

                  <br/><br/>(e) No Class Actions.
                  <br/>YOU AGREE THAT YOU MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST YourUnity ONLY IN YOUR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE MORE THAN ONE PERSON’S CLAIMS, MAY NOT PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF CLASS, CONSOLIDATED OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING AND MAY ONLY PROVIDE RELIEF IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO PROVIDE RELIEF WARRANTED BY THAT PARTY’S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM.

                  <br/><br/>(f) Notice of Dispute.
                  <br/>A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other a typed Notice of Dispute (“Notice”). The Notice to YourUnity must be sent to the email address in Section 5.6 above (“Notice Address”) and must be sent by an email registered through the Services. The Notice to you must be delivered to your YourUnity account email address. The Notice must (i) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the specific relief sought. If YourUnity and you do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within sixty (60) calendar days after the Notice is received, you or YourUnity may commence an arbitration proceeding.

                  <br/><br/>(g) Arbitration Proceedings.
                  <br/>The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules, or, if the actions giving rise to the dispute or claim relate to your personal or household use of the Services (rather than business use), the Consumer Arbitration Rules (in each case, the “AAA Rules”) of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by this Section 5.9, and will be administered by the AAA and settled by a single arbitrator. The AAA Rules are available online at adr.org or by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879. The arbitrator is bound by the terms of these Terms of Service. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, including, but not limited to, issues relating to the scope, enforceability, and arbitrability of this Section 5.9. Unless YourUnity and you agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in a reasonably convenient location in the United States for both parties with due consideration of their ability to travel and other pertinent circumstances. If the parties are unable to agree on a location, AAA shall determine the location. If your claim is for ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, we agree that you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If your claim exceeds ten thousand dollars ($10,000), the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. All decisions by the arbitrator shall be final and binding and judgment on the award rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.

                  <br/><br/>(h) Costs of Arbitration; Legal Fees.
                  <br/>i. Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator costs and expenses imposed by AAA will be governed by the AAA rules, provided that if you are initiating an arbitration against YourUnity. In the event that the arbitrator determines that all of the claims you assert in arbitration are frivolous according to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11, you agree to reimburse YourUnity for all such cost and expenses that YourUnity paid and that you would have been obligated to pay under the AAA rules.
                  <br/>ii. Just as in any court proceeding, each party will initially bear its own attorneys’ fees and expenses in connection with any arbitration. Should either party be determined to have substantially prevailed in the arbitration, then upon such party’s request, the arbitrator shall award such prevailing party the reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses that it incurred in connection with the arbitration. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the reimbursement of attorneys’ fees and expenses upon request from either party made within fourteen (14) days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the merits.

                  <br/><br/>(i) Future Changes.
                  <br/>Notwithstanding any provision in these Terms of Service to the contrary, you and YourUnity agree that if YourUnity makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) YourUnity will provide you with notice of such change and you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within thirty (30) calendar days of the change to the Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision as unmodified by such rejected change.

                  <br/><br/>(j) Special Severability.
                  <br/>In the event that the provisions of Section 5.9(e) above are found to be invalid or unenforceable for any dispute or claim, then, notwithstanding Section 5.10, the entirety of this Section 5.9 shall be null and void with respect to such dispute or claim and Section 5.11 shall apply in lieu of this Section 5.9.

                  <br/><br/>(k) Opt Out.
                  <br/>We believe that on a whole this agreement to arbitrate will benefit our Users. There is no option to opt-out and this provision will be effective as to such new accounts upon account creation. For unregistered Attendees and other Users, this provision will apply to all future activities on the Services after September 1, 2017.

                  The failure or delay of YourUnity to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. No oral waiver, amendment or modification shall be effective under any circumstance whatsoever. If any provision of these Terms of Service is found by an arbitrator or court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, the parties nevertheless agree that the arbitrator or court should endeavor to give effect to the parties’ intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of these Terms of Service shall remain in full force and effect.
              </p>

          <h2>5.11 Judicial Forum.</h2>
              <p>
                  In the event that the Agreement to Arbitrate above is found not to apply to you or to a particular claim or dispute, then any dispute or claim not subject to arbitration shall be resolved exclusively by a federal court located in San Diego County, California, and to the extent there is no subject matter jurisdiction in such federal court, then a state court in San Diego County, California. Both you and YourUnity agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction and venue of such courts and agree that such forum is convenient.
              </p>
