      <h1>1. Who We Are.</h1>
          <h2>1.1 YourUnity.</h2>
              <p>
                  Welcome to YourUnity! We are a platform dedicated to building a stronger and more connected community by increasing awareness of and interaction with various community service events. Through our platform, mobile apps and services, we leverage the latest technology in order to reduce any barriers involved on both sides of the community service process. We are not a social media organization, as our aim is not to increase media consumption. Rather YourUnity aims to provide an avenue through which a User may more efficiently interact with the community around them.

          <h2>1.3 Users.</h2>
              <p>

We refer to Organizers, Attendees and other visitors and browsers of the Services collectively as “Users” or “you.”

      <h1>9. Sub-domains.</h1>
          <p>
              YourUnity may provide you with the right to use a sub-domain within the Site (e.g., [sub-domain prefix].YourUnity.com) for a given event. All such sub-domains are the sole property of YourUnity and we reserve the right to determine the appearance, design, functionality and all other aspects of such sub-domains. In the event YourUnity provides you with a sub-domain, your right to use such sub-domain will continue only for so long as your event is actively selling on the Services and you are in compliance with the Terms of Service, including without limitation, these Terms of Use.

          <p>
              YourUnity may, upon request, and for such fees as YourUnity may establish from time to time in its sole discretion, provide additional services to you beyond the basic functionality of the Site and Applications, including without limitation, marketing and promotion services, and providing on-site entry management consultants to assist you with your event set-up. All such additional services, whether provided prior to, during or following your event, shall be deemed a part of the Services and subject to all the terms and conditions of the Terms of Service, including without limitation, these Terms of Use. Such additional services shall be set forth in additional terms and conditions or other written agreements between you and an authorized officer of YourUnity, and shall set forth the applicable fees and the other terms and conditions relating to such additional services.
          </p>

      <h1>11. Service Modifications.</h1>
          <p>
              YourUnity isn’t a job shop, it isn’t a white label solution, it isn’t a social media platform, and it isn’t a walled garden built specifically for each Organizer. We are constantly evolving our products and services to better meet the needs of our entire user base. Because of this, we do not guarantee any set of product features or functionality and reserve the right at any time to, and from time to time may, modify, suspend or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of the Services for any reason.
          </p>

      <h1>12. Links.</h1>
          <h2>12.1 Third Party Websites.
              <p>
                  The Services may provide, or Users may provide, links to other Internet websites or resources. Because YourUnity has no control over such websites and resources, you acknowledge and agree that YourUnity is not responsible for the availability of such websites or resources, and does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any Content, advertising, products, services or other materials on or available from such websites or resources, or any damages or losses related thereto, even if such websites or resources are connected with YourUnity partners or third party service providers.
              </p>

          <h2>12.2 Linked Accounts.</h2>
              <p>
                  As part of the Services you may be able to link an account you have with a third party service, such as a social media website. By linking such third party account, you agree that YourUnity may access, make available to and store any Content that you have provided to and stored in such third party account so that it is available on or through the Services. Such content may include personally identifiable information.
              </p>

      <h1>13. Privacy; Customer Information.</h1>
          <h2>13.1 Privacy Policy.</h2>
              <p>
                  All information provided by Users or collected by YourUnity in connection with the Services is governed by YourUnity’s Privacy Policy, a copy of which is located <a href="/legal/privacy">here</a>. The Privacy Policy is incorporated into the Terms of Service by reference. YourUnity strongly recommends that you review the Privacy Policy.
              </p>

          <h2>13.2 Co-Ownership.</h2>
          <p>
              YourUnity follows a “co-ownership model” with respect to Attendee Information (as defined below). This means that all Attendee Information inputted by an Attendee on event pages posted by an Organizer on the Services will be shared with the applicable Organizer and may also be used by YourUnity in accordance with our Privacy Policy, including marketing or promotion of other events or services that may be of interest to the applicable Attendee. Each Attendee acknowledges and agrees to this sharing and understands and agrees that each Organizer is solely responsible for the use of Attendee Information that was provided to such Organizer through the Services and that YourUnity is responsible only for its own use of Attendee Information. Each Organizer represents, warrants and agrees that (a) it will at all times comply with all applicable local, state, provincial, national and other laws, rules and regulations with respect to Attendee Information; (b) it will at all times comply with any applicable policies posted on the Services with respect to Attendee Information; and (c) upon a request of a given Attendee or as permitted in Section 8.2 of these Terms of Use, YourUnity is authorized at its discretion to delete or anonymize Attendee Information of a requesting Attendee from the Services at which time it will no longer be available to Organizer through the Services or will no longer be linked to an identifiable Attendee through the Services. However, Attendees should note that Attendee Information may still be available in the Organizer’s own databases if transmitted prior to YourUnity receiving the underlying request. For purposes of this Section, “Attendee Information” means information about a given Attendee made available on or through the Services, including, without limitation, name, address, e-mail address, past event attendance, event interests, and phone numbers.
